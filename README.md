### Introduction
I aim to implement a simple DNS server in Rust in order to understand network programming, work with async Rust and understand the DNS protocol.

### Technical Overview
#### Parts of Project
- UDP Server: handle incoming queries
- Query Parser: parse requests for DNS
- Resolver: lookup IP address
- Response: return DNS packets to client

#### Checkpoint 1 Submission
- Understand the DNS protocol, Asynchronous Rust and basics of network programming
- Implement a simple UDP server to send and receive packets
- Implement query parsing

#### Checkpoint 2 Submission
- Implement IP lookup and resolution
- Implement a cache

#### Final Submission
- Implement sending a response to the client
- Load testing and optimizations

### Possible Challenges
1. Working with async programming could be difficult
2. Implementing a UDP server is time-consuming and requires strong knowledge of the protocol
